## Responsible AI Use

This project uses AI technology to provide exercise explanations and guidance. We are committed to responsible AI practices:

### Our Commitments

1. **Accuracy & Safety**: AI-generated exercise advice is reviewed for safety and accuracy. We prioritize beginner-friendly modifications and proper form guidance.

2. **Transparency**: Users are informed when they're receiving AI-generated content. All exercise explanations clearly indicate they come from an AI assistant.

3. **Data Privacy**: User workout data is stored locally on their device. No personal fitness information is shared with third parties or used for AI training.

4. **Limitations Awareness**: We acknowledge that AI-generated fitness advice should not replace professional medical or fitness guidance. Users with health concerns should consult healthcare providers before starting any exercise program.

5. **Bias Mitigation**: We strive to provide inclusive fitness guidance that considers various fitness levels, abilities, and backgrounds. Exercise modifications are offered to accommodate different needs.

6. **Human Oversight**: AI-generated content is designed to supplement, not replace, evidence-based fitness principles. Our exercise library is curated by the development team.

### User Responsibilities

- Consult a healthcare provider before starting any new exercise program
- Listen to your body and stop if you experience pain or discomfort
- Verify AI-generated exercise advice with reliable fitness resources when uncertain
- Report any concerning or unsafe AI-generated content to the development team
